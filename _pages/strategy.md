## Mission

Equipping ESDC developers with skills, knowledge and tools to continuously modernize the software they develop.

We want the developers at ESDC to be collaborating with each other and those from other departments, gaining skills to build into a greater diversity of knowledge, enabling them to develop stronger and more versatile software.

## Platforms

We are all about using the best tool for the job based on a given scope.
With the ESDC Development Community we have picked three main tools to achieve our goals; GitHub, Slack, and WebEx.

**GitHub** is used for

* Gathering suggested topics
* Common location for information (Recommendations, Guides, References, Event Dates)

**Slack** is used for

* Q&A & Help
* Collaboration
* Updates & Announcements

**WebEx** is used for
  
* Live presentations
* Live collaboration

## How

### Sessions

Sessions are currently our main point of contact with the Development Community where we bring updates on the available tooling and direction of development for the department.
The main focus of the sessions is a form of training where we will highlight existing best practices used by other teams, and demonstrate examples of using tooling.

We want to bring [topics](https://github.com/esdc-devcop/esdc-devcop.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atopic) the community wants to hear about, so we have an **[open submission](https://github.com/esdc-devcop/esdc-devcop.github.io/issues/new?assignees=&labels=topic&template=potential-devcop-topic.md&title=Topic%3A+) and voting (:+1:) on suggested [topics](https://github.com/esdc-devcop/esdc-devcop.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atopic)**.

We understand that we have a diverse audience, so we have two 1 hour sessions every month.
The first being an updates and overview on a general [topic](https://github.com/esdc-devcop/esdc-devcop.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atopic) with an open discussion.
The second being an in-depth dive into the underlying workings of the [topic](https://github.com/esdc-devcop/esdc-devcop.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atopic) and allowing for questions on how to really utilize the idea within existing solutions.

### Recommendations & Guides

We are committed to being open to requests for new and updated recommendations and guides on anything the community wants more details on.

* [Make a Recommendation Request](https://github.com/esdc-devcop/recommendations/issues/new?assignees=&labels=request&template=recommendation-request.md&title=Request%3A+)
* [Make a Guide (How to...) Request](https://github.com/esdc-devcop/guides/issues/new?assignees=&labels=request&template=guide-request.md&title=Request%3A+)
