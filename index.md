## Our Goal

Equipping ESDC developers with skills, knowledge and tools to continuously modernize the software they develop.  
We want the developers at ESDC to be collaborating with each other and those from other departments, gaining skills to build into a greater diversity of knowledge, enabling them to develop stronger and more versatile software.

## How

### DevCoP Presentations

DevCoP presentations are currently our main point of contact with the Development Community where we bring updates on the [available tooling]({{ '/' | absolute_url }}tools.html) and direction of development for the department. The main focus of the DevCoP presentations is a form of training where we will highlight existing [best practices and guides]({{ '/' | absolute_url }}guides/) used by other teams, and demonstrate examples of using [tooling]({{ '/' | absolute_url }}tools.html).
We have a DevCoP presentation every month (excluding July and August). You can view the [presentations]({{ '/' | absolute_url }}events/) that are planned for the year.
