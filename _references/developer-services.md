This page is designed to show you some common tools that you might not have been aware of that will improve your development practices and make the life of a developer at ESDC easier.

## Department Built Tools

### Enterprise Web Services

There are a few web services available. They are all supported and documented on [GCcode here](https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/iitb-dgiit/sds/ews).

### Wet Templates

The CDTS currently has an API to implement the WET 4.0 into any application. You can read more on that on the GCPedia page: [Centrally_Deployed_Templates_Solution_(CDTS)](https://cenw-wscoe.github.io/sgdc-cdts/index.html).  
SDS also offers a more integrated template for .NET MVC, .NET Web Forms and Java applications. The details on that can be found in GCCode page: [GoC Web Templates project](https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/GOCWebTemplates).

### Web Analytics

The department has a site to view the website analytics on a number of different web sites and applications. <http://web-stats.prv/Index-e.asp> can be used to view the stats of the applications you develop.

## 3rd Party Tools

### GC Code

[GC Code](https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/)
is using GitLab; you can store your code base here, manage branches and checkins, track bug and tasks, store all of your documentation, all in one tool! SDS is moving to it for all of the EWS and the WET .NET & Java Templates.
There is a recommendation on GC Code for IITB found here: <https://github.com/esdc-edsc/Welcome/blob/master/Recommendations/GCcode.md>

### NuGet

The department has access to the NuGet repositories as well as hosting its own internal source for home brewed applications.
