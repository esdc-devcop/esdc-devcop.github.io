# ESDC's Developer's Community of Practice

This repository is used as the main home for our community site.
<https://esdc-devcop.github.io/>

We publicize all our [recommendations](https://esdc-devcop.github.io/recommendations/) and [guides](https://esdc-devcop.github.io/guides/) on through separate repos, but are still available under the same site.
Here we keep information about [upcoming sessions](https://esdc-devcop.github.io/strategy/dates.html), share [our goals](https://esdc-devcop.github.io/strategy/overview.html), and keep some [useful links](https://esdc-devcop.github.io#References) for developers.

## Help Out

We welcome contributions from anybody.
Feel free to fork and submit a Pull Request (PR) to any of our repos.
