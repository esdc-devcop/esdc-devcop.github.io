## Strategy

Each month we will focus on one core [topic](https://github.com/esdc-devcop/strategy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atopic) that could be actioned and implemented by a team with less than half a day's work. 
Each month will build on the previous where it will lead teams to developing better and faster applications though increasing automation and reducing feed-back loops.

There are four key parts to making this all work:

- [Info Sessions](#info-sessions)
- [Hands on Sessions](#hands-on-sessions)
- [Management Support](#management-support)
- [Community Building & Engagement](#community-building-engagement)

### Info Sessions

Holding monthly sessions that will introduce the montly topic and layout the plan of how to implement the topic.
These sessions will be hosted simmilar to 'Ted Talks' or 'Coffee and Learn' with a short Q&A period.
These sessions should also regularly be bringing in members from other areas of IITB to give a less than 5 min update on what they are working on. 
(Areas to concider: Testing, Accessibility, Security, QA, DBA)

### Hands on Sessions

Thoughout the month we will be planning 'Workshops' or 'Hackathos' that are targeting teams to help them implement that topic of the month.
We will look at using experts and the community as a whole to help with these events.

### Management Support

We will be providing support to teams that are keen on implementing these topics but are reciving resistance from managment.
Working with managment on what the precive to be preventing them from acepting the implementation to demonstrate how they can do it now.

### Community Building & Engagement

We will keep a focus on keeping the community engaged and invlovled in the various ativities though social media and advertising methods.
