Q: I saw multiples interesting functionalities like the ReadMe.md (i.e.: for the file project configuration) and the Wiki section in markdown. Would you recommand to use the Wiki functionnaliy for replacing our current SPECS document using MS Word. Personally  , I see a lot of pros to use GitLab. Centralize everything, any docs at the same place.
