# GitLab-Runner Installation and Maintenance

[https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/)

## Requirements

* Elevated permissions

## Installing

For installing on the ESDC corperate image follow the walk-through GitLab provides for [installing on Windows](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/windows.html).
_You should probably be downloading the `amd64` binary_.

### Registering runners

You should register your runner to any project or group that you work on.
If you do not have access to the runners settings ask the Owner of the Group or Maintainer of the Project you want to add it to, for the gitlab-ci token.

### Environment variables

You will likely need to add environment variables for your runner.
The environment variables should point to things that might be different on different computers.

In order to add environment variables, edit the `config.toml` file where you installed the `gitlab-runner.exe` and add something similar to the following line under `executor` for each runner you have registered.

```toml
environment = ["NUGET_PATH=C:\\Git\\NuGet\\NuGet.exe", "MSBUILD_PATH=C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\14.0\\Bin\\msbuild.exe"]
```

You should also add a tag (`nuget` & `msbuild`) to the runner for each environment variable you add.
You may need to ask the Owner of the Group or Maintainer of the Project to update the tags on your runner though the GitLab UI.

### Running PowerShell scripts

You may need your runner to be able to execute PowerShell scripts.
In order to do that you will have to adjust the settings of the user account you run the runner with.
To do so, open a powershell command line as the user you run the runner with, and execute the following line.

```powershell
set-executionpolicy remotesigned -scope currentuser
```

> You can view the settings for all users by running `get-executionpolicy -list`

## Maintenance

_We are looking into the option of writing a script that would do all this for you._

### Logon as a service

Sometimes after rebooting your computer, the runner will turn off and you will need to give the user permissions to "logon as a service".
To do that:

* Run _Services_ with elevated permissions
* Go to the _Properties_ of _gitlab-runner_ service
* Go to _Log On_ and re-enter your _Password_
* Click _OK_
* Click _Start_

### Updates

Check every few months for updates (put a reminder in your calendar) and follow the instructions.
