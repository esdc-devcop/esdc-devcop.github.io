## What are we talking about?

**Where are we at?**  
--

.whoah[Broken manual builds, poorly documented features, not user-focused, complicated intertwined systems]
--


**Where do we need to be?**  
--

Cloud-enabled, automated deployments, focused and isolated features
--


**What is practical right now?**  
--

.okay[All of it!]
--


**How do we get there?**  
--

Small incremental steps. 
Breaking out of what we are comfortable with to do what is better.
Collaborating to share what works.

## A Starting Point

### Platform

Where and how do we develop code?   
How do we enable ourselves to be the most effective at achieving our goals?

## Why Git?

It's not an arbitrary choice, and it's not one that was looked at lightly.
- Globally accepted standard
- Versatility of being distributed (DVCS)
- Free & Open-Source!!
- Enabling better development practices
- Critical in taking further steps towards modern application development.
- And finally, even Microsoft made the jump!!!

There are tools to help the transition!

## About Git

Free and open source version control system used for tracking changes in code during development

Similar but at the same time, very different from other version control systems (ex. SVN)

--

Distributed 

- every developer’s working copy of code has a full history of all changes

--

Advantages of using Git

- available offline
- efficient
- no single point of failure

???

By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. 
Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel.  

Having a distributed architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS (hence Distributed Version Control System). 
Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN).
In Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.  

In addition to being distributed, Git has been designed with performance, security and flexibility in mind.

## About Git

The branching model has been made easy
- Main branches:
 - Master
 - Develop

- Supporting branches:
 - Feature
 - Release
 - Hotfix

--

Stages of Git
 - Working directory
 - Staging area
 - Git directory

## When can you start migrating to Git? 

--

### .okay[Right now!]
---

## Migrating to Git

### How can you do it?

--

#### 1. Add a Git repository to your TFS Team Project.

- TFS supports mixing Git and TFVC repos in the same project.
- Integrated Git support in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.
  - You will want to learn some basic commands.

???
- Git is the default version control provider in TFS and Azure DevOps.

--

#### 2. "Clone" your TFVC into a local Git repository.

- There's a tool for that! .okay[**git-tfs**]
  - Recommended by [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/develop/git/migrate-from-tfvc-to-git), [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/tfvc.html) and Git-SCM's [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-and-Other-Systems-Migrating-to-Git#_git_tfs).
  - Tool takes a long time to process. (~30 mins for 1 GB TFVC repo)

--

#### 3. Push local Git repo to Git hosting service.

- One basic command: `git push`
---

## Migration Tool

### git-tfs - Sample Run

```cs
# Clone from existing TFS Team Project.


# Push to remote repository. 

```
---

class: middle, center

## How do you deal with the history?
---

## Migrating to Git

### Keep your history in the past!

--

#### Microsoft suggests doing *.okay[tip migrations]*.

- Bring only a snapshot of the most recent version of a branch into Git.

--

#### Why?

- Messy process, at best.
- Possibly misleading.
- High level of effort involved.
- Relative rarity usage of the history.

--

#### Where *do* you keep the history then?

- In your old TFS Team Project or TFVC repository.
- Refer to your old repositories in your README.md files.

"For most development teams, the time spent trying to migrate history is typically better spent on other areas of the migration that have a higher return on investment, especially improving processes. [...] **.whoah[In almost all cases, we recommend the tip migration.]**"

## Moving day! But first, *the* choice...
---

## Hosting your Git Repositories

### Pick a hosting service for your version control.

  - **TFS or Azure DevOps** - *Status Quo*
  - **GCcode** - *New Initiatives/Projects*
  - **GitHub** - *End Goal*

???
Git Hosting Services are where your remote repositories will live.

They all provide their own flavour of tools and methodologies around DevOps, Issue Tracking, etc.

## Hosting your Git Repositories

### TFS or Azure DevOps *(Online and On-Premise)*

.column-first[
- Status Quo
- Keep your old toys.
  - Work Items
  - Build/Release Definitions
  - Test Plans
  - etc.
- Improved usability with Azure DevOps.
