## Background

Broken links on your website makes for a bad user experience and can also lower the ranking of your web site in search engine optimization (SEO). No one wants to click on a link only to get an HTTP 404 error page.
Two ways to prevent this from happening is with prevention and detection.

## Types of links:

Internal Links:
These are links that point to another page on your site. As the owner of a website, you have full control over maintaining these links.

External Links:
These are links that point to an external website. As the owner of a website, you should choose trustworthy and informative website links to help improve the quality and ranking of your website.

Backlinks:
These are external websites that link to your site. You may not have much control over these. However, by publishing useful content on your website, you can boost your ranking on search results.

## Steps

Create a Custom 404 page for your website:
Display a custom 404 page to handle broken internal and external links, that will be more helpful to the user on what to do next. Custom design is good, in moderation. You can make it funny, just don't make it confusing.
